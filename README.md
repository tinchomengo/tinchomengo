- 👋 Hi, I’m @tinchomengo, formally known as Martin Araya Mengo

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development with native languages (HTML,CSS,JS) but I am also interested in frameworks use such as React, Vue.js and Angular.js which I have just started to learn.

- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on projects that involve Agile Methodologies and contribute to a big purpose. Such as, the main project of a startup or any project from a well-known company.
